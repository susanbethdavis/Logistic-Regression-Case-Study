Background
The Commercial Banking Corporation (hereafter the “Bank”), acting by and through its department of Customer Services and New Products is seeking proposals for banking services. The Bank ultimately wants to predict which customers will buy a variable rate annuity product.
A variable annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company / bank, under which the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to you, beginning either immediately or at some future date. You purchase a variable annuity contract by making either a single purchase payment or a series of purchase payments.
A variable annuity offers a range of investment options. The value of your investment as a variable annuity owner will vary depending on the performance of the investment options you choose. The investment options for a variable annuity are typically mutual funds that invest in stocks, bonds, money market instruments, or some combination of the three. If you are interested in more information, see: http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/varannty.htm

The project will be broken down into 3 phases:
• Phase 1 – Variable Understanding and Assumptions
• Phase 2 – Variable Selection and Modeling Building
• Phase 3 – Model Assessment and Prediction
